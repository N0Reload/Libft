# Libft
2d Project in 42

The libft project builds on the concepts we learned during the day06 on 'the piscine' of the bootcamp
ie code a library of useful functions that we will be allowed to reuse in most of our C
projects this year. This will save us a lot of precious time.

This project is easy too, like the first (because it's litteraly the same but in more complicated),
we just need to recreate some functions of the libc on C, and create some useful functions.

I join the subject on the repository. Let's Check !
